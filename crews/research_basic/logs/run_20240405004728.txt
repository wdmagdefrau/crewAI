CFOs should ensure that financial strategies are aligned with customer value creation. This involves involving finance teams in product development discussions and utilizing finance-derived insights to guide business decisions. Such an approach not only improves product design and customer satisfaction but also drives revenue growth by focusing on delivering superior value to customers.

**5. Embrace Next-Generation Managed Services**

The shift towards next-generation managed services offers a strategic opportunity for CFOs to enhance core competencies and drive innovation. By selecting managed services partners that align with the companyâ€™s strategic goals, CFOs can leverage external expertise to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and focus internal resources on strategic initiatives. This requires a thorough evaluation of potential managed services providers and a clear understanding of the desired outcomes from such partnerships.

**6. Prioritize Technological Transformation in Wealth Management**

For CFOs in family offices and wealth management, adopting AI and advanced technologies is essential for optimizing investment strategies and identifying new opportunities. Investing in technology to enhance data analysis capabilities enables more informed decision-making and better risk management.
