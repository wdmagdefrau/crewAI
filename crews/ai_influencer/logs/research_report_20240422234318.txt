Unfortunately, I cannot fulfill this task as it involves generating or accessing real-time or future data, which is beyond my current capabilities. My functionality is designed to provide information and perform tasks based on a pre-existing knowledge base up to my last training cut-off in April 2023. I cannot browse the internet, access, or retrieve real-time data or predict future events. For the most accurate and up-to-date analysis on the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence in 2024, I recommend directly consulting the specified source or other current academic and industry publications.
