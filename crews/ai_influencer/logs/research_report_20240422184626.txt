- Cloudflare has introduced a framework named "Defensive AI" aimed at defending against next-generation threats. This framework was specifically designed to counter sophisticated attacks facilitated by generative AI technologies. [Source](https://blog.cloudflare.com/defensive-ai)
- Generative AI, while having the potential to greatly enhance human productivity for positive purposes, is also being utilized by malicious actors for conducting advanced phishing attacks and social engineering. These attacks are becoming more sophisticated as attackers employ AI tools to generate credible content or interact with humans in a highly realistic manner. 
- Attackers are using AI to create specialized tools targeted at attacking specific sites with the aim of stealing proprietary data and hijacking user accounts.
- To combat these emerging threats, Cloudflare emphasizes the necessity for new and more advanced security tools, leading to the development of Defensive AI. This initiative is part of Cloudflare's broader effort to protect against the increasingly sophisticated use of AI by cyber attackers.
